Dearest, darlingest Momsie and Popsical
My dear Father
There's been some confusion over rooming here at Shiz
But of course, I'll care for Nessa
But, of course, I'll rise above it
For I know that's how you'd want me to respond
Yes

There's been some confusion for, you see, my roommate is
Unusually and exceedingly peculiar
And altogether quite impossible to describe
Blonde

What is this feeling, so sudden and new
I felt the moment I laid eyes on you?
My pulse is rushing
My head is reeling
Yeah, well, my face is flushing

What is this feeling, fervid as a flame?
Does it have a name?
Yes

Loathing
Unadulterated loathing
For your face, your voice, your clothing
Let's just say, I loathe it all
Every little trait, however small
Makes my very flesh begin to crawl

With simple, utter loathing
There's a strange exhilaration
In such total detestation
It's so pure, so strong
Though I do admit it came on fast
Still I do believe that it can last
And I will be loathing, loathing you my whole life long

Dear Galinda, you are just too good
How do you stand it? I don't think I could
She's a terror, she's a tartar
We don't mean to show a bias
But, Galinda, you're a martyr
Well, these things are sent to try us

Poor Galinda, forced to reside
With someone so disgusticified
We just want to tell you, we're all on your side!
We share your loathing

What is this feeling, so sudden and new (unadulterated loathing)
I felt the moment I laid eyes on you? (For her face, her voice, her clothing)
My pulse is rushing (let's just say)
My head is reeling (we loathe it all)

Oh, what is this feeling? (Every little trait, however small)
Does it have a name? (Makes our very flesh begin to crawl)
Yes, ah, ah

Loathing (loathing)
There's a strange exhilaration (loathing)
In such total detestation (loathing)
It's so pure, so strong (so strong)
Though I do admit it came on fast
Still I do believe that it can last
And I will be loathing, for forever loathing
Truly, deeply loathing you (loathing you)
My whole life long (loathing, unadulterated loathing)

Boo!
Ah!
