Dearest darlingest momsie and popsical
My dear father
There's been some confusion
Over rooming here at Shiz
But of course, I'll care for Nessa
But of course, I'll rise above it
For I know that's how you'd want me to respond
Yes, there's been some confusion
For you see, my room-mate is
Unusually and exceedingly peculiar
And altogether quite impossible to describe
Blonde
What is this feeling
So sudden and new?
I felt the moment
I laid eyes on you
My pulse is rushing
My head is reeling
My face is flushing
What is this feeling?
Fervid as a flame
Does it have a name?
Yes!
Loathing
Unadulterated loathing
For your face
Your voice
Your clothing
Let's just say, I loathe it all!
Every little trait, however small
Makes my very flesh begin to crawl
With simple utter loathing
There's a strange exhilaration
In such total detestation
It's so pure! So strong!
Though I do admit it came on fast
Still I do believe that it can last
And I will be loathing
Loathing you
My whole life long!
Dear Glinda, you are just too good!
How do you stand it? I don't think I could!
She's a terror! She's a tartar!
We don't mean to show a bias
But Glinda you're a martyr!
Well, these things are sent to try us!
Poor Glinda, forced to reside
With someone so disgusticified
We just want to tell you
We're all on your side!
We share your
What is this feeling! Loathing!
So sudden and new?
I felt the moment
I laid eyes on you
My pulse is rushing
My head is reeling
Oh, what is this feeling?
Does it have a name?
Yes
There's a strange exhilaration
In such total detestation
It's so pure, so strong!
So strong!
Though I do admit it came on fast
Still I do believe that it can last all
And I will be loathing
For, forever loathing
Truly, deeply loathing you loathing you
My whole life long!
Unadulterated loathing
Boo
