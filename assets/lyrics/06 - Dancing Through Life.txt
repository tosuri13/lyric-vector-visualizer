I see that once again
That the responsibility to corrupt my fellow students falls to me

The trouble with schools is
They always try to teach the wrong lesson
Believe me, I've been kicked out of enough of them to know
They want you to become less callow, less shallow
But I say, why invite stress in?
Stop studying strife
And learn to live the unexamined life

Dancing through life, skimming the surface
Gliding where turf is smooth
Life's more painless for the brainless
Why think too hard when it's so soothing?

Dancing through life, no need to tough it
When you can slough it off as I do
Nothing matters but knowing nothing matters
It's just life, so keep dancing through

Dancing through life, swaying and sweeping
And always keeping cool
Life is fraughtless when you're thoughtless
Those who don't try never look foolish

Dancing through life, mindless and careless
Make sure you're where less trouble is rife
Woes are fleeting, blows are glancing
When you're dancing through life

Let's go down to the Ozdust Ballroom
We'll meet there later tonight
We can dance 'til it's light
Find the prettiest girl
Give her a whirl
Right on down to the Ozdust Ballroom
Come on, follow me
You'll be happy to be there

Dancing through life (down at the Ozdust)
If only because dust is what we come to
Nothing matters but knowing nothing matters
It's just life (ah)
It's just life
So keep dancing through

Galinda, um, I hope you'll save a dance for me tonight
I'll be right there, waiting all night
That's so kind
But you know what would be even kinder?

See that tragically beautiful girl?
The one in the chair
It seems so unfair
We should go on a spree
And not she, gee
I know someone would be my hero
If that someone were
To go invite her

Well, maybe I could invite her
Oh, Bick, really?
You would do that for me?
I would do anything for you

You're good
I don't know what you mean
I love helping others
Oh, and I happen to be free tonight, after all

Now that we've met one another
It's clear we deserve each other
You're perfect, you're perfect
So we're perfect together
Born to be forever
Dancing through life

You'll never guess what just happened to me
That perfectly adorable Munchkin boy just asked me out
He said he was too shy to ask me out first
But then Galinda emboldened him (wait, Galinda?)
Don't, don't you dare say another word against her
I'm about to have the happiest night of my life
Thanks to Galinda

Finally, for this one night
I'm about to have a fun night
With this Munchkin boy Galinda found for me
And I only wish there were
Something I could do for her
To repay her

Elphaba, see?
We deserve each other
And Galinda helped it come true
We deserve each other, me and Boq
Please, Elphaba, try to understand
I do

Galinda, um
Nessa and I were talking about you just now, and-
Well, we were just talking about you
How you should join us tonight
At the Ozdust
And don't tell me you have nothing to wear
Because you could wear this
I mean, it goes with everything you own

It's really, uh, sharp, don't you think?
You know, black is this year's pink
You deserve each other, this hat and you
You're both so- smart
You deserve each other, so here
Out of the goodness of my heart

Listen, Nessa?
Yes?
Uh, Nessa
I've got something to confess
A reason why, well
Why I asked you here tonight

And I know it isn't fair
Oh, Boq, I know why
You do?
It's because I'm in this chair
And you felt sorry for me
Well, isn't that right?

No, oh, no, no
I don't feel sorry for you
You're great, I asked you because, because-
Because you are so beautiful!
Oh, Boq, I think you're wonderful!
And we deserve each other
Don't you see? This is our chance

We deserve each other
Don't we, Boq?
You know what?
Let's dance
What?
Let's dance!

Dancing through life here at the Ozdust
If only because dust is what we come to
And here's the strange thing, your life could end up changing
While you're dancing through
