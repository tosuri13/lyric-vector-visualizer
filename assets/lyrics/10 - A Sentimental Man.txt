(My heart's desire is for you to help the animals)
I had a feeling you were gonna say that
And I agree wholeheartedly
(That makes me so happy)
Now, that's what I do best, making people happy

I am a sentimental man
Who always longed to be a father
That's why I do the best I can
To treat each citizen of Oz as son or daughter
So Elphaba, I'd like to raise you high
'Cause I think everyone deserves the chance to fly
And helping you with your ascent allows
Me to feel so parental
For I am a sentimental man
