One short day
If you only have
If you only have one short day
One short day in the Emerald City
One short day in the Emerald City

One short day
One short day
One short day
One short day
In the Emerald City
Emerald City

One short day in the Emerald City
One short day full of so much to do
Every way that you look in the city
There's something exquisite
You'll want to visit
Before the day's through

There are buildings tall as Quoxwood trees
Dress salons and libraries
Palaces, museums
A hundred strong

There are wonders like I've never seen
It's all grand and it's all green
I think we've found the place where we belong

I wanna be in this hoi polloi
So I'll be back for good someday
To make my life and make my way
But for today we'll wander and enjoy

One short day in the Emerald City
One short day to have a lifetime of fun
One short day
And we're warning the city
Now that we're in here
You'll know we've been here before we are done

(Presenting the absolute factual story of the wonderful Wizard of Oz)
(Starring the Emerald City players)

Long, long ago
Long before we can recall
There lived here in Oz
The magical wise ones
(Ah-ah-ah, the magical wise ones)
The wisest of them all

We will not live forever
That, I can foresee
So let us set down all our magic
In a strange and secret language
In a book, The Grimmerie (the Grimmerie)
But time ticked ever onward day by day (ah)
And all those who could read it passed away (ah)
'Til one day no one could
But the wise ones left a prophecy

In Oz's darkest hour
Though we cannot say when
There will come one with a power
To read The Grimmerie again
And Oz which had been sad and blah
Once more will sing a joyous "Ah!"

Look! (Ah)
A man in a balloon arriving from the sky! (Ah)
Maybe he is here to fulfill the prophecy!
But can he read The Grimmerie?

This man who comes out of the blue
Is he the prophecy?
There's one way we'll know if it's true!
Fetch The Grimmerie! (The Grimmerie)
Oh-ma-ha, oh-ma-ha
He can read it!
He must be-, a wizard!

The prophecy fulfilled
What merriness he'll bring
Now every Ozian raise their voice and sing
And sing
And sing

Who's the mage whose major itinerary is making all Oz merrier?
Who's the sage who sagely sailed in to save our posteriors?
Whose enthuse for hot air ballooning
Has all of Oz honeymooning? Ooh
Isn't he wonderful?
Our wonderful wizard

One short day in the Emerald City
One short day to have a lifetime of fun
What a way to be seeing the city
Where so many roam to
We'll call it home too

And then just like now we can say
We're just two friends
Two good friends
Two best friends
Sharing one wonderful
One short (the Wizard will see you now!)
Day
