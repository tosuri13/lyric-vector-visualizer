Elphaba, why couldn't you have stayed calm for once?
Instead of flying off the handle?

I hope you're happy
I hope you're happy now
I hope you're happy how you've hurt your cause forever
I hope you think you're clever

I hope you're happy
I hope you're happy too
I hope you're proud how you would grovel in submission
To feed your own ambition

So though I can't imagine how
I hope you're happy right now

Elphie, listen to me, just say you're sorry
You can still be with the Wizard
What you've worked and waited for
You can have all you ever wanted

I know
But I don't want it
No, I can't want it
Anymore

Something has changed within me
Something is not the same
I'm through with playing by the rules of someone else's game
Too late for second-guessing
Too late to go back to sleep
It's time to trust my instincts
Close my eyes and leap

It's time to try defying gravity
I think I'll try defying gravity
And you can't pull me down

Can't I make you understand
You're having delusions of grandeur?

I'm through accepting limits
'Cause someone says they're so
Some things I cannot change
But 'til I try, I'll never know
Too long I've been afraid of
Losing love, I guess I've lost
Well, if that's love, it comes at much too high a cost

I'd sooner buy defying gravity
Kiss me goodbye, I'm defying gravity
And you can't pull me down

Come with me
Think of what we could do together

Unlimited
Together, we're unlimited
Together, we'll be the greatest team there's ever been, Glinda
Dreams the way we planned 'em
If we work in tandem
There's no fight we cannot win

Just you and I, defying gravity
With you and I, defying gravity
They'll never bring us down

Are you coming?

I hope you're happy
Now that you're choosing this
You too
I hope it brings you bliss
I really hope you get it
And you don't live to regret it

I hope you're happy in the end
I hope you're happy, my friend

No, leave her alone, she hasn't done anything wrong
I'm the one you want, I'm the one you want, it's me!
It's me!

So if you care to find me
Look to the western sky
As someone told me lately
"Everyone deserves the chance to fly"

And if I'm flying solo
At least I'm flying free
To those who'd ground me
Take a message back from me

Tell them how I am defying gravity
I'm flying high, defying gravity
And soon I'll match them in renown

Unlimited
Unlimited
Unlimited

And nobody in all of Oz
No Wizard that there is or was
Is ever gonna bring me down

I hope you're happy (look at her, she's wicked, kill her!)
Bring me down (no one mourns the wicked, so we've got to bring her)
Ah! (Down!)
(Down! Ah!)
