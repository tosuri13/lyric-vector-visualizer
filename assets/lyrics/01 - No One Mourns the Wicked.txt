Good news! The Witch, she's dead
Come out, come out, she's gone
Good news! She's dead
The Witch of the West is dead
The wickedest witch there ever was
The enemy of all of us here in Oz is dead
Good news! Good news!

Look, it's Glinda

Let us be glad
Let us be grateful
Let us rejoicify that goodness could subdue
The wicked workings of you-know-who
Isn't it nice to know
That good will conquer evil?
The truth we all believe'll by and by
Outlive a lie
For you and-

No one mourns the wicked
No one cries, "They won't return!"
No one lays a lily on their grave
The good man scorns the wicked
Through their lives, our children learn
What we miss when we misbehave

And goodness knows the wicked's lives are lonely
Goodness knows the wicked die alone
It just shows when you're wicked, you're left only
On your own

Yes, goodness knows the wicked's lives are lonely
Goodness knows the wicked cry alone
Nothing grows for the wicked, they reap only
What they've sown

(Miss Glinda, why does wickedness happen?)
That's a good question
Are people born wicked?
Or do they have wickedness thrust upon them?
After all, the Wicked Witch had a childhood
She had a father who, by the way, had been appointed governor of Munchkinland
(I'm off to the Assembly, dear)
And she had a mother, as so many do

How I hate to go and leave you lonely
That's alright, it's only just one night
But know that you're here in my heart while I'm out of your sight

And like every family, they had their secrets

Have another drink, my dark-eyed beauty
I've got one more night left here in town
So have another drink of green elixir
And we'll have ourselves a little mixer
Have another little swallow, little lady, and follow me down

And one thing led to another, as it so often does (no!)
But from the moment the witch was born, she was, well, different

It's coming
(Now?)
(The baby's coming)
(Oh, and how!)
I see a nose
I see a curl
It's a healthy, perfect, lovely little- (oh)
(Oh, sweet Oz, oh)

How can it be? (What does it mean?)
It's uncanny (it's obscene!)
Like a froggy, ferny cabbage
The baby is unnaturally
Green
Take it away, take it away!

And so, it couldn't have been easy

No one mourns the wicked
Now at last, she's dead and gone
Now at last, there's joy throughout the land

And goodness knows (goodness knows)
We know what goodness is (ah)
Goodness knows the wicked die alone (she died alone)
Woe to those (woe to those)
Who spurn what goodnesses
They are shown

No one mourns the wicked (good news!)
No one mourns the wicked (good news!)
No one mourns the wicked!
Wicked!
Wicked!
