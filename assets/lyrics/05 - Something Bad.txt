We animals are now being blamed for everything that goes wrong
Forced from our jobs, told to keep silent

I've heard of an ox, a professor from Quox
No longer permitted to teach
Who has lost all powers of speech
And an owl in Munchkin Rock
A vicar with a thriving flock
Forbidden to preach
Now he only can screech!

Only rumors but still enough to give pause
To anyone with paws
Something bad is happening in Oz
(Something bad happening in...?)
That's it, I'm leaving Oz, while I can still speak the word goodbye

Doctor Dillamond
If animals are losing the ability to speak, and leaving Oz
Then someone's got to tell the Wizard
That's why we have a Wizard

So nothing bad
(Perhaps you're right)
Nothing all that bad
Nothing truly bad
(Sorry, bad... must be catching a cold)

It couldn't happen here
In Oz
