(Glinda! Is it true you were her friend?)
(Yes, I mean I did know her)
(That is, our paths did cross, at school)

O hallowed halls and vine-draped walls
The proudliest sight there is
When grey and sere our hair hath turned
We shall still revere the lessons learned
In our days at dear old Shiz
Our days at dear old

Oh-oh-oh-oh-old
Dear old Shiz
